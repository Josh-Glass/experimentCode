In one of the experiments you participated in, you were shown a variety of geometric shapes, and were asked to learn how to classify them.  You were then asked to generalize your training to geometric shapes that had not yet been classified.  Finally, you were asked to learn additional types of geomtric shapes that were added amongst the ones you had already been trained on.  There is substantial eveidence that generalization of classification training can be based on how close the features of a new example are to the features of the already learned examples.  However, recent evidence suggests this generalization can also be based upon inducing some form of global regularity that all examples follow.  For instance, two examples could be said to belong to the same class if they share an underying regularity, rather than having features that are merely close to each other. This experiment sought to investigate this distinction by seeing how people learn and generalize different category structures.  We also wanted to see how training on some categories might affect later training on new categories within the same domain- this was the purpose of the final portion of the experiment.
