Now it is time to move to the next phase: You will be asked to use your knowledge to decide which type of geometric shape is being presented. Some of the geometric shapes will be exactly the same as those in the training phase, but some will be completely new. Since some unclassified geometric shapes will be included in this phase, there will not be corrective feedback as you had in training.
